These subjects include English, where learners can enhance their language skills with discussions on grammar, literature, writing, and communication strategies.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In Mathematics, users can dive into topics ranging from basic arithmetic to advanced calculus, algebra, and more, with peers and experts guiding the way. The Science server allows participants to explore disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, and environmental science through interactive lessons and problem-solving sessions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Social Studies offers discussions about history, geography, economics, and civics, helping learners develop a well-rounded understanding of global and local dynamics. The Computer/IT server is focused on coding, data structures, algorithms, web development, and IT management, providing a space for users to enhance their technical skills.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lastly, the Random Subject server offers a flexible space for learners to explore various other topics or fields of study, allowing for spontaneous discussions and interdisciplinary learning.</p>
